/**
 * A minimal, cross-chain signer interface.
 *
 * Only the universally-required surface is enforced here:
 *  - derive: create a child signer from a relative derivation path
 *  - getAddress: return the public address for this signer
 *  - dispose: clear any secret material from memory
 *
 * Chain-specific signers (EVM, BTC, Tron, Solana, etc.) can extend this
 * contract with additional capabilities (e.g., signTransaction, signTypedData,
 * signPsbt), but those are intentionally not included here to keep the base
 * interface chain-agnostic.
 *
 * Common optional fields/methods implementers may provide:
 *  - isActive: boolean
 *  - index: number | undefined
 *  - path: string | undefined
 *  - address: string | undefined
